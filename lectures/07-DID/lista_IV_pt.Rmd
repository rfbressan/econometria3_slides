## Questão 1

Consider the canonical DID setup with T = 2 and N = 2.
$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 State_i + \beta_2 Post_t + \theta D_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}$$
suppose the time variable is omitted. Thus the estimating equation is
$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 State_i + \beta_2 Post_t + \varepsilon_{it}$$
where $D_{it}= State_i \cdot Time_t$ is the treatment indicator.

(a) Find an algebraic expression for the least squares estimator $\hat\theta$.

(b) Show that $\hat\theta$ is a function only of the treated sub-sample and is not a function of the untreated sub-sample.

(c) Is $\hat\theta$ a difference-in-differences estimator?

(d) Under which assumptions might $\hat\theta$ be an appropriate estimator of the treatment effect?

## Questão 2



## Questão 3

Take the basic difference-in-differences model
y i t = θD i t + u i + δ t + ε i t .
Instead of assuming that D i t and ε i t are independent, assume we have an instrumental variable z i t
which is independent of ε i t but is correlated with D i t . Describe how to estimate θ.
Hint: Review Section 17.28.
